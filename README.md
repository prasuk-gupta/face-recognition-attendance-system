# AI-Based Face Recognition Attendance & Surveillance System

This project implements a real-time face recognition system using YOLO for face detection and FaceNet for face recognition. The system is inspired by real-world surveillance and access control pipelines.

## Features
- Real-time face detection using YOLO
- Face recognition using FaceNet embeddings
- Duplicate attendance prevention
- Timestamp-based CSV logging
- CPU/GPU compatible

## Tech Stack
- Python
- OpenCV
- YOLOv8
- FaceNet (InceptionResnetV1)
- PyTorch

## Use Case
Smart attendance systems, access control, and surveillance analytics.
