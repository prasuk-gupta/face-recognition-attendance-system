# face-recognition-attendance-system
Developed a real-time face recognition attendance system using YOLOv8 and FaceNet. The system performs face detection, embedding-based identity matching, prevents duplicate entries, and logs attendance with timestamps, demonstrating practical application of computer vision and AI pipelines.
